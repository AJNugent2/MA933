The module webpage can be found [here](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/courses/msc/ma933/).

Lecturer: [Susana Gomes](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/maths/people/staff/gomes/) 

Teaching Assistant: [Kamran Pentland](https://warwick.ac.uk/fac/sci/mathsys/people/students/2019intake/pentland/)

## Getting started
* Simply download (or clone) the repository to a new folder in on your laptop. 
* Fire up any of the notebooks using Jupyter notebook. 

Notebooks will be uploaded before each support class. If something is not working, get in contact with me.

## Other helpful informtion
This will be updated as the module progresses. 

### LaTeX
It's recommended you use Overleaf (particularly useful for group projects as multiple people can work on the same document at the same time). You can sign up with your Warwick details (and you should have access to premium features): [https://www.overleaf.com/](https://www.overleaf.com/)
